## Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm Riad, a 25-year-old tech enthusiast who thrives on bridging the gap between innovative ideas and real-world applications. 🌍 With a knack for software engineering, DevOps, AI, and MLOps, I love crafting solutions that not only solve problems but also make the world a bit more exciting.

## My Tech Adventure 🚀

My journey started with a curiosity for coding at the age of 12, and it's taken me from the vibrant streets of Morocco ✨ to the beautiful landscapes of Canada 🏔️.

### Academic

I dove headfirst into the world of technology at the [ENSAM](http://www.ensam-umi.ac.ma/?lang=en), where I earned a Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering, specializing in AI and Data Science. I was honored to be the valedictorian of my class in 2022, proving that a little curiosity can go a long way!

Continuing my academic adventure at the [Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR)](https://www.uqar.ca/), I'm getting another Master’s degree in Engineering and I'm working as a Research Professional at [LMP3](https://lmp3.ca/) in Canada 🇨🇦. Here, I've been crafting AI and software engineering projects that turn futuristic ideas into reality across multiple industries.

### Professional

My professional escapades began at [AI-Inside Private](https://www.ai-inside-private.com/) in Morocco 🇲🇦, where I transformed challenges into solutions with machine learning and software engineering. Teaming up with [AGC](https://www.agc.com/en/) in Belgium 🇧🇪, a multinational glass company, I enhanced their DevOps and MLOps workflows and deployed a robust ELK stack to streamline their log management. Along the way, I mastered technologies like Kubernetes, Rancher, and AWS, adding new tools to my tech toolbox.

Each role fuels my passion for technology, inspiring me to keep exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape.

## What Gets Me Excited

I relish the challenge of developing sophisticated software systems and making the seemingly impossible happen with technology. Whether it's optimizing DevOps pipelines, engineering robust software, or deploying cutting-edge AI models, I'm always up for a challenge.

## Fun Tidbits

- Tackled Google’s [foo.bar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) Coding Challenge — caffeine-free! (mostly).
- Valedictorian of my class in 2022 👨‍🎓 — no pressure, right?
- Fluent in English, French, and Arabic, because why not?
